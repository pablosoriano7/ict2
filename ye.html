      <h2>W3C: </h2>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences,<br> 
      powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. <br>
        The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, disability organizations, government, <br>
        and research labs from around the world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.<br>
       
        <h2>WAI:</h2>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. <p>
        People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, <p>
        making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources. <p>
