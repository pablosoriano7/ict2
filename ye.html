      <h2>W3C: </h2>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences,<br> 
      powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. <br>
        The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, disability organizations, government, <br>
        and research labs from around the world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.<br>
