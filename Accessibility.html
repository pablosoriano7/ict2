      <h2>W3C: </h2>W3C standards define an Open Web Platform for application development that has the unprecedented potential to enable developers to build rich interactive experiences,<br> 
      powered by vast data stores, that are available on any device. <br>
        The W3C Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) brings together people from industry, disability organizations, government, <br>
        and research labs from around the world to develop guidelines and resources to help make the Web accessible to people with auditory, cognitive, neurological, physical, speech, and visual disabilities.<br>
       The headquarters of the W3C is in Massachusetts.

        <h2>WAI:</h2>
        The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)'s Web Accessibility Initiative (WAI) is an effort to improve the accessibility of the World Wide Web (WWW or Web) for people with disabilities. <br>
        People with disabilities may encounter difficulties when using computers generally, but also on the Web. Since people with disabilities often require non-standard devices and browsers, <br>
        making websites more accessible also benefits a wide range of user agents and devices, including mobile devices, which have limited resources. <br>
        
        
        
        <h2>WCGA:</h2>
        Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) is developed through the W3C process in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, <br>
        with a goal of providing a single shared standard for web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals,organizations, and governments internationally.<br>

The WCAG documents explain how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Web “content” generally refers to the information in a web page or web application, including:<br>

        <li>natural information such as text, images, and sounds</li>
        <li>code or markup that defines structure, presentation, etc.</li>
