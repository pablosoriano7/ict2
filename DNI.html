First of all, we will have to check whether we meet the minimum technical requirements for hardware and software for its use.<p>
In the case of the eID, it will be mandatory to have a smart card reader, which can be integrated into the keyboard or connected to the computer via USB or PCMCIA card.<p>

DNI 3.0 allows the possibility to sign electronically via NFC, in which the device must comply with ISO 14443 Standard regarding e-identification cards, <p>
especially proximity cards.

Regarding software, both DNIe and DNI 3.0 are ready to be used in any operating system, such as:<p>

        <li>Microsoft Internet Explorer (6.0 or later)</li><p>
        <li>Mozilla Firefox (1.5 or later)</li><p>
        <li>Netscape (4.78 or later)</li><p>
If we are going to sign using a smart card reader, we will need to have both cryptographic modules (which varies depending on the operating system or browser) and drivers of the reading device.<p>

        <h2><strong>Sign electronically from the App: </h2> </strong><p>
In order to sign, we must open the document to be signed via our software solution.<p>

The process for signing step by step will vary depending on the tool we will be using. <p>
        In the case of Viafirma, this is a very simple and intuitive procedure. Whether using a card reader or NFC, the solution will recognize the certificate as any other in the operating system. <p>
        You only need to select the certificate and use it.<p>

Generally speaking, you will first need to select the document, which can be viewed prior to signing, to then sign it, which will require the verification PIN of our DNIe or DNI 3.0. <p>
       This code is provided to us when we receive the PIN and we can change it if we want to.<p>

Therefore, as we can see, getting the most out of the DNIe and DNI 3.0 only requires a few simple steps that can be done from practically any device or operating system. <p>

We must admit that the need to have a card reader or NFC devices can be an obstacle for many citizens, and is one of the reasons for which signing with the DNIe is not fully established in Spain. <p>
 There are other qualified signature solutions, such as the signature with a certificate installed on the device and, most importantly, remote signatures using the certificate in the cloud, which does not require any specific hardware or peripherals.<p>

In any case, this is a way to gain time, comfort and legal support for all citizens who have access to administrative procedures, as well as the option of signing documents digitally with the help of a specialized software, such as the one offered by Viafirma.<p>
