         <h2>Active Attacks: </h2>
       Active attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker efforts to change or modify the content of messages. <br>
          Active Attack is danger for Integrity as well as availability. Due to active attack system is always damaged and System resources can be changed.<br>
          The most important thing is that, In active attack, Victim gets informed about the attack.<br>

         <h2>Passive Attacks: </h2>
       Passive Attacks are the type of attacks in which, The attacker observes the content of messages or copy the content of messages. <br>
         Passive Attack is danger for Confidentiality. Due to passive attack, there is no any harm to the system. <br>
         The most important thing is that In passive attack, Victim does not get informed about the attack. <br>

         <h2> Computer worm: </h2> A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer.<br>
         A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.<br>
        
         <h2> Trojan: </h2>
         A Trojan horse or Trojan is a type of malware that is often disguised as legitimate software. Trojans can be employed by cyber-thieves and hackers trying to gain access to users' systems.<br>
         Users are typically tricked by some form of social engineering into loading and executing Trojans on their systems. Once activated, Trojans can enable cyber-criminals to spy on you, <br> 
         steal your sensitive data, and gain backdoor access to your system.<br>
         
         <h2>Software and hardware to protect network: </h2>
         Network Security protects your network and data from breaches, intrusions and other threats. This is a vast and overarching term that describes <strong>hardware and software </strong> solutions <br>
         as well as processes or rules and configurations relating to network use, accessibility, and overall threat protection. <br>
         Network Security involves access control, virus and antivirus software, application security, network analytics, types of network-related security (endpoint, web, wireless), firewalls, VPN encryption and more. <br>

         <h2>Network protocols: </h2>
         
         A network protocol is an established set of rules that determine how data is transmitted between different devices in the same network <br>
         <ul>
         <li>Secure Sockets Layer ,<strong>SSL </strong> ,is a networking protocol designed for securing connections between web clients and web servers over an insecure network, such as the internet.</li>
             
        <li> Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure ,<strong> HTTPS </strong> ,is an extension of the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). It is used for secure communication over a computer network, and is widely used on the Internet.</li>
         In HTTPS, the communication protocol is encrypted using Transport Layer Security (TLS) or, formerly, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL). </li>
    
        <li> <strong>IPv6</strong> is an Internet Layer protocol for packet-switched internetworking and provides end-to-end datagram transmission across multiple IP networks </li>
         </ul>
      
    <h2>Digital certificates and certificate authorities: </h2>
    A certificate authority (CA), also sometimes referred to as a certification authority, is a company or organization that acts to validate the identities of entities <br>
    (such as websites, email addresses, companies, or individual persons) and bind them to cryptographic keys through the issuance of electronic documents known as digital certificates.<br>
    Digital certificates can be described as electronic passwords issued by a trusted third party, a certification authority (CA). They can be attached to electronic messages to verify that the sender of a message is really who he or she claims to be. <br>
    Without digital certificates, it wouldnâ€™t be possible for two parties to share their public keys in a way that can be authenticated.<br>
